# Getting-a-Good-night-sleep
My first project on Python/ Data Science

Project Description:
Sleep is essential for both physical and mental health. Quality sleep repairs cells, consolidates memories, wards off disease, and much more. In this project, you'll be working as a data science consultant for SleepInc, a sleep-tracking startup, and your mission is to analyze anonymous sleep data from their SleepScope app to uncover insights into lifestyle factors affecting sleep quality and duration.

Tools used: Pandas
